    <h1>CSS Transitions Examples</h1>
    <!-- CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties.
    Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.
    For example, if you change the color of an element from white to black, usually the change is instantaneous.
    With CSS transitions enabled, changes occur at time intervals that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized.
    Animations that involve transitioning between two states are often called implicit transitions as the states in between the start and final states are implicitly defined by the browser.
